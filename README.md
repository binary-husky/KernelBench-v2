## ✨ What's New in KernelBench-v2

- **Triton Integration**: Native support for Triton kernels with automatic detection and a production-ready evaluation pipeline (`scripts/run_and_check_triton.py`).
- **Unified Evaluation**: CUDA and Triton kernels now share the same correctness and performance metrics.
- **Docker Environment**: Reproducible environment via the root `Dockerfile` (CUDA 12.4 + Triton + PyTorch 2.5).
- **Robust Error Handling**: 15+ categorized runtime/compilation error classes for easier debugging.
- **Compile-Cache Builder**: New `build_compile_cache_triton` helper for fast batched evaluation.
- **Expanded Docs**: See `TRITON_README.md` for a quick start and `TRITON_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for an in-depth technical deep-dive.

## 👋 Task Description
We structure the problem for LLM to transpile operators described in PyTorch to CUDA kernels, at whatever level of granularity it desires to.
![KernelBenchMascot](./assets/figures/KernelBenchWorkFlow.png)

We construct KernelBench to have 4 Levels of categories:
- **Level 1 🧱**:  Single-kernel operators (100 Problems)
    The foundational building blocks of neural nets (Convolutions, Matrix multiplies, Layer normalization)
- **Level 2 🔗**:  Simple fusion patterns (100 Problems)
    A fused kernel would be faster than separated kernels (Conv + Bias + ReLU, Matmul + Scale + Sigmoid)
- **Level 3 ⚛️**:  Full model architectures (50 Problems)
    Optimize entire model architectures end-to-end (MobileNet, VGG, MiniGPT, Mamba) 
- **Level 4 🤗**:  Level Hugging Face 
    Optimize whole model architectures from HuggingFace

## ⚖️ Evaluation
#### Methodology
To evaluate model-generated kernels, we need to check if they:
- **is correct ✅**: check against reference torch operators `n_correctness` times on randomized inputs.
- **is performant ⏱️**: compare against reference torch operators `n_trial` times to measure speedup between runtimes.

Check out `src/eval.py` for details on how we implement correctness check and timing. 

We provide a convenient script `scripts/run_and_check.py` to evaluate one single sample source code against a reference source code, check correctness and compute speedup. You can use this to evaluate a model-generated kernel. 

#### Overall Benchmark Metric

Since we need to capture **both** correctness and performance, we define a metric `fast_p`: fraction of tasks that are both correct and have a speedup greater than threshold `p`; speedup is computed as the ratio of PyTorch reference wall-clock time to generated kernel time.

Some examples to illustrate this metric that filters based on speedups:
* `fast_1` is the fraction of tasks that LM-generated kernels are both correct and **faster** than PyTorch baseline
* `fast_2` is the fraction of tasks that LM-generated kernels are both correct and **at least 2x faster** than PyTorch baseline
* `fast_0` is the fraction of tasks that LM-generated kernels are **correct**. (same as correctness rate)

You can increase speedup threshold `p` to make the task more challenging.

#### Compute Overall Benchmark Performance

We provide a script `scripts/greedy_analysis.py` to compute the overall benchmark performance.

## 🔧 Set up
```
conda create --name kernel-bench python=3.10
conda activate kernel-bench
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e . 
```

> **uv set up** (GPU required):
> ```bash
uv venv --python=3.10
source ./.venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
uv pip install -e .
> ```

> **Docker Quick-Start** (GPU required):
> ```bash
> # 1. Build image & launch dev container
> docker compose up --build -d  # spins up `kernelbench-triton`
>
> # 2. Attach an interactive shell (optional)
> docker exec -it kernelbench-triton bash
> ```

> **Note (v2)**: If you intend to run or evaluate Triton kernels, also install Triton with `pip install triton`.

To call LLM API providers, set your `{INFERENCE_SERVER_PROVIDER}_API_KEY` API key.

Running and profiling kernels require a GPU. 
If you don't have GPU available locally, you can set up [Modal](https://modal.com/). Set up your modal token after creating an account by running `modal token new`. Then, use the `generate_and_eval_single_sample_modal.py` script.

## 🚀 Usage
### Run on a single problem 
It is easier to get started with a single problem. This will fetch the problem, generate a sample, and evaluate the sample.

```
# for example, run level 2 problem 40 from huggingface

python3 scripts/generate_and_eval_single_sample.py dataset_src="huggingface" level=2 problem_id=40

# dataset_src could be "local" or "huggingface"
# add .verbose_logging for more visbility
```

### 🔥 **NEW: Triton Kernel Support**
KernelBench now supports both CUDA and Triton kernels with automatic detection!

```bash
# Evaluate Triton kernels with auto-detection
python3 scripts/run_and_check_triton.py \
    ref_origin=kernelbench \
    level=1 \
    problem_id=1 \
    kernel_src_path=your_triton_kernel.py

# See TRITON_README.md for complete guide
```

### Run on all problems 

```
# 1. Generate responses and store kernels locally to runs/{run_name} directory
python3 scripts/generate_samples.py run_name=test_hf_level_1 dataset_src=huggingface level=1 num_workers=50 server_type=deepseek model_name=deepseek-chat temperature=0

# 2. Evaluate on all generated kernels in runs/{run_name} directory
python3 scripts/eval_from_generations.py run_name=test_hf_level_1 dataset_src=local level=1 num_gpu_devices=8 timeout=300

# If you like to speedup evaluation, you can use parallelize compilation on CPUs before getting to evluation on GPUs
# add build_cache=True and num_cpu_workers=<num_cpu_workers> to the command
```
### Analyze the eval results to compute Benchmark Performance
We provide `scripts/benchmark_eval_analysis.py` to analyze the eval results to compute success rate, timing metric, and overall benchmark performance  `fast_p`. 

```
python3 scripts/benchmark_eval_analysis.py run_name=test_hf_level_1 level=1 hardware=L40S_matx3 baseline=baseline_time_torch
```
If you are using a different hardware, you can generate the baseline time with `scripts/generate_baseline_time.py` script.
We provide some reference baseline times a variety of NVIDIA GPUs across generations in `results/timing`, but we recommend you to generate your own baseline time for more accurate results (cluster power, software version, all affects timing result). See `results/timing/README.md` for more details.

### Multi-Turn Framework
We have also releaed the test-time framework [Caesar](https://github.com/simonguozirui/caesar) that are used in the multi-turn / iterative refinement experiments in our paper. You can use or modify this framework for high-throughput test-time scaling (both sequential and parallel) targeting KernelBench problems.
